# MazeBuilder

[Demo.](https://pakkudon.github.io/MazeBuilder)

Toy project based off of an assignment from uni. The original assignment was to implement certain maze generation and maze solving algorithms in C++.

## Technology used
- HTML / CSS
- JavaScript + jQuery
- Bootstrap

## Development instructions
This project has no build process. To view your changes locally start a web server of your choice in the project root. Eg:
```sh
npx http-server -c-1 .
```

To deploy your changes to Github Pages push your branch to `gh-pages`
```sh
git push origin <development branch name>:gh-pages
```

## Algorithms used
#### Maze-builder algorithms:
- Depth-first search
- Randomized Kruskal's
- Randomized Prim's
- Eller's

#### Maze-solver algorithms:
- Depth-first search
- Breadth-first search
- A* Search
- Uniform-cost Search
